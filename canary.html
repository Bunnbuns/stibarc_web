This canary should be updated on the first of every month, but may experience delays of up to a week if I forget.

As of right now, I have not been contacted by any member of law-enforcement from any country regarding STiBaRC, any of its services, or any of its users. This is accurate as of 2020-01-24 04:00 UTC.

To prove that this canary hasn't been written and signed ahead of time, here are some recent news articles from The New York Times:
